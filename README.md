# DISARM
Repository for "DISARM: Detecting the Victims Targeted by Harmful Memes" @ NAACL'22 (Findings)

The enclosure has the following (besides a readme.txt):
<ol>
<li> requirements.txt
<li> LightWt_basic_model_BERT_Supplementary.ipynb
<li> LightWt_basic_model_BERT_Supplementary.py
</ol>

The enclosed .py file contains all the code in the pipeline in sequence.
It can be preferrably run by placing blocks sequentially in a notebook.
Or the notebook itself can be ran.
