The enclosure has the following (besides a readme.txt):
1. requirements.txt
2. LightWt_basic_model_BERT_Supplementary.ipynb
3. LightWt_basic_model_BERT_Supplementary.py

The enclosed .py file contains all the code in the pipeline in sequence.
It can be preferrably run by placing blocks sequentially in a notebook.
Or the notebook itself can be ran.
